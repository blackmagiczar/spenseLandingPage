# spenseLandingPage
Landing Page for a fictional company called spense

During this project I learnt:
-How to make a landing page.
-How to use media queries and flexbox to make a webpage responsive to mobile, tablet and desktop screen sizes.
-How to make a hidden menu that pops up when clicking on the hamburger icon.

It was a great project, I learnt a lot.
